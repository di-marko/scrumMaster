        <h2>What is Agile? What is Scrum?</h2>
        <p>
          <strong>Agile</strong>
          is a mindset: a set of values and principles. These values and principles are presented in the
          <a class="links" href="https://www.agilealliance.org/agile101/the-agile-manifesto/">Agile Manifesto</a>
          .
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Scrum</strong>
          is a way in which this mindset can be applied. It is an iterative approach where a team of 4-6 people
          regularly deliver a working product (feature) that meets the user's stories.
        </p>
        <p>You can say that Scrum is Agile, however, Agile doesn't have to be Scrum.</p>
